Hey! I'm a boilerplate for your next FE project.

## Versionning

We use `standard-version` to do automatic versionning and CHANGELOG generation. You can always use the vanilla `npm publish` if your want to.

## Storybook

Simply create your stories in `src/**/*.stories.tsx`. They are written in the CSF format. Have a look a the examples in `src/stories` folder.
